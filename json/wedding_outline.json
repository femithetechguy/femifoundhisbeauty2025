Even from that initial distance, there was an undeniable, powerful feeling that he was the one. We exchanged only a brief \"hi\" that night, a prelude to what was to come.",

Then, about three gigs in, at a friend's album launch, everything changed. This time, he wasn't on the guitar, giving us the perfect chance to talk, and we even shared a casual dance. The conversation flowed effortlessly, and he was struck by her captivating intelligence and the undeniable sparkle in her eyes as they spoke. He asked to exchange contact info ‚Äì we did, and a quiet promise of future conversations blossomed into an unprecedented union. From that moment, our story truly began.",
