# üìù Formspree Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you configure Formspree for all forms in your wedding website.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Create Formspree Account
1. Visit [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

### 2. Create Forms in Formspree Dashboard

You need to create **3 separate forms** in your Formspree dashboard:

#### Form 1: RSVP Form
- **Name**: "Wedding RSVP"
- **Description**: "Guest RSVP responses for Beauty & Femi 2025"

#### Form 2: Contact Form  
- **Name**: "Wedding Contact"
- **Description**: "General inquiries for Beauty & Femi 2025"

#### Form 3: Gallery Upload
- **Name**: "Photo Upload"
- **Description**: "Guest photo submissions for Beauty & Femi 2025"

### 3. Get Form IDs

After creating each form, Formspree will provide you with a unique form ID (looks like `xpzgkqyw`).

### 4. Update JSON Configuration

Edit `json/wedding_outline.json` and replace the placeholder IDs:

```json
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "rsvp",
      "content": {
        "form": {
          "formspreeId": "YOUR_ACTUAL_RSVP_FORMSPREE_ID",
          "action": "https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_ACTUAL_RSVP_FORMSPREE_ID"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "contact",
      "content": {
        "form": {
          "formspreeId": "YOUR_ACTUAL_CONTACT_FORMSPREE_ID", 
          "action": "https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_ACTUAL_CONTACT_FORMSPREE_ID"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "gallery",
      "content": {
        "uploadForm": {
          "formspreeId": "YOUR_ACTUAL_GALLERY_FORMSPREE_ID",
          "action": "https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_ACTUAL_GALLERY_FORMSPREE_ID"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## üìß Email Configuration

### Notification Emails

1. **RSVP Form**: Set notification email to your wedding planning email
2. **Contact Form**: Set to your main contact email

### Auto-Reply Messages
Set up custom auto-reply messages for each form:

#### RSVP Auto-Reply
