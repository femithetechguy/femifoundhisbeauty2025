# RSVP Form Bug Fix

This document provides multiple solutions to fix the issue with the RSVP form where conditional sections don't appear when selecting "Yes, I'll be there! Can't wait to celebrate with you!".

## Quick Solutions

Choose one of these options to fix the issue:

### Option 1: Use the Simple Standalone RSVP Page

A completely redesigned RSVP page that works independently of any existing code:

- **File**: `simple-rsvp.html`
- **How to use**: Simply link to this page from your main site or replace your existing RSVP page with this one.
- **Benefits**: Clean implementation without dependencies on existing code.

### Option 2: Add the Standalone CSS Solution

A CSS-only solution that uses multiple selectors to show/hide conditional sections:

- **File**: `styles/standalone-rsvp.css`
- **How to add**: Add the following line to your HTML `<head>` section:
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/standalone-rsvp.css">
  ```
- **Benefits**: No JavaScript required, works even if JS is disabled.

### Option 3: Add the Standalone JavaScript Solution

A robust JavaScript solution that finds and handles form elements:

- **File**: `scripts/standalone-rsvp.js`
- **How to add**: Add the following line just before the closing `</body>` tag:
  ```html
  <script src="scripts/standalone-rsvp.js"></script>
  ```
- **Benefits**: Works with various HTML structures, adaptable to different forms.

### Option 4: Combined Solution (Recommended)

For maximum reliability, use both the CSS and JavaScript solutions together:

1. Add the CSS link to your `<head>` section
2. Add the JavaScript script before the closing `</body>` tag
3. Consider also adding this inline script for immediate execution:

```html
<script>
  // Immediate fix for RSVP form
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // Find yes radio
    const yesRadio = document.querySelector('input[name="attendance"][value="yes"]') || 
                     document.querySelector('#yesRadio') || 
                     document.querySelector('input[value="yes"]');
                     
    // Find conditional sections
    const conditionalSections = document.querySelectorAll('#conditional-sections, .conditional-section, #attendance-details');
    
    // If yes is checked, show sections
    if (yesRadio && yesRadio.checked) {
      conditionalSections.forEach(section => {
        section.style.display = 'block';
        section.style.visibility = 'visible';
      });
    }
    
    // Add change handler
    if (yesRadio) {
      yesRadio.addEventListener('change', function() {
        if (this.checked) {
          conditionalSections.forEach(section => {
            section.style.display = 'block';
            section.style.visibility = 'visible';
          });
        }
      });
    }
  });
</script>
```

## Debugging Tips

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check Console Output**: Open your browser's developer tools and check the console for any JavaScript errors.

2. **Verify Element Structure**: Use the browser's inspector to verify that:
   - The radio buttons have the correct `name` and `value` attributes
   - The conditional sections have the expected IDs or classes
   - There are no CSS rules that might be overriding the visibility

3. **Test HTML Structure**: Ensure that the conditional sections are properly structured in relation to the radio buttons.

4. **Try Multiple Browsers**: Some CSS selectors (like `:has()`) may not work in older browsers.

## How the Fixes Work

1. **Simple Page**: Completely redesigned form with simplified HTML/CSS/JS that works independently.

2. **CSS Solution**: Uses multiple selector patterns to target conditional sections based on radio button state.

3. **JavaScript Solution**: Uses multiple strategies to find elements and explicitly shows/hides them.

4. **Combined Approach**: Implements redundant solutions that work together for maximum reliability.
